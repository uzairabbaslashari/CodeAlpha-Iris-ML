# Iris Machine Learning Project 🌸📊

This project is my **first task** as part of the **Code Alpha Data Science Internship**.

In this project, I developed a **Machine Learning classification model** using the **Iris dataset**, which is directly loaded from `sklearn.datasets`.  
No external dataset download is required.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand and implement a complete **machine learning workflow**, including:
- Loading the Iris dataset
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Training a machine learning model
- Evaluating model performance

---

## 🔹 Project Files
- `iris_model.py` – Contains the complete Python code for the machine learning model

---

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (if applicable)

---

## 🔹 Internship Details
- **Organization:** Code Alpha  
- **Domain:** Data Science  
- **Task:** First Internship Task ✅  

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of **machine learning concepts, data handling, and practical model implementation**.
